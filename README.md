# Mr. Roboger's Neighborhood

#### Looping and Array Independent Project for Epicodus, 6/25/2021

#### By Lucian Miller

## Description

Count with Mr. Roboger from 0 with a number you give him! Be careful though, as sometimes Mr. Roboger says other things instead of the number. This website was used to test the knowledge I have learned with loops and Array's so far and implement them into one cohesive site.
